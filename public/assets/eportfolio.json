        "description": "Tried the Pomodoro method (25-minute work blocks + 5-minute breaks) during a busy audit week.",
        "reflection": "This was my first week experimenting with time management techniques. The Pomodoro method worked when I was studying at home, but at work, interruptions made it difficult to complete cycles. By the end of the week, I felt frustrated and realized that not every technique fits every environment. Still, it was a good first step in learning how I work best.",

        "reflection": "Time-blocking worked much better than Eisenhower for me. I could visually see my day, set realistic boundaries, and stick closer to finishing work around 4:30 PM. This helped me carve out time for family, gym, and personal projects. I felt less overwhelmed and more in control.",
