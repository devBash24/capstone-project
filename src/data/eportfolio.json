        "description": "Tried the Pomodoro method (25-minute work blocks + 5-minute breaks) during a busy audit week.",
        "reflection": "This was my first week experimenting with time management techniques. The Pomodoro method worked when I was studying at home, but at work, interruptions made it difficult to complete cycles. By the end of the week, I felt frustrated and realized that not every technique fits every environment. Still, it was a good first step in learning how I work best.",
